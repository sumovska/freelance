				<h2 class="h2">About BoatPilot</h2>
				<p>BoatPilot is an interactive electronic pilot, navigator and social network for seamen that started being developed by a group of professional yachtsmen in 2012.</p>
				<p>Our goal is to create a quality free product that is available to skippers to not only obtain information that is needed to navigate a sea vessel quickly and efficiently, but to be able to make necessary additions to it and moderate the existing database of the community. As such, we make a product that propagates a “community for community” philosophy, instead of the traditional “business for the consumer” approach.</p>

				<h2 class="h2">Frequently Asked Question</h2>
				<p class="h">On which platforms does BoatPilot function?</p>
				<p>At the moment, BoatPilot operates on Android, as it is the leader in operating systems for tablets. We are planning to release BoatPilot on iOS in the fall of 2014. Windows Mobile will support the application no sooner than the end of 2014. Nevertheless, some of the functions of BoatPilot can be used on any platform if you go to our site using your browser.</p>
				<p class="h">I have an Android phone, why can’t I download BoatPilot?</p>
				<p>BoatPilot is optimized to be used on tablets only and cannot be downloaded on a phone as it cannot function, due to technical restrictions of a smartphone. If you don’t have a tablet that runs on Android, you can purchase it on our site with BP already downloaded and functioning. Prices start at $200.</p>
				<p class="h">How much do I need to pay for the BP license?</p>
				<p>The base version of BoatPilot is free.</p>
				<p class="h">I found a mistake on the map, what should I do?</p>
				<p>All of the information that is contained in BoatPilot is donated and moderated by the community. If you found a mistake, please enter what it is and save your changes. The changes will be visible once the members of the community affirm them.</p>
